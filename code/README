lb is a distributed MPI-based load balancer and data-store.

lb depends on:
 * c-utils, for data structures and other utilities

lb is being developed as part of the ExM project.  For further details

The lb source code was originally derived from ADLB-M. For further

To build lb:

    ./setup.sh
    export CC=mpicc
    ./configure --with-c-utils=<PATH/TO/CUTILS> \
                --prefix=<INSTALL/PATH>
    make
    make install

To enable MPE debugging:
    --with-mpe=</PATH/TO/MPE/DIR>

To enable ADLB debug logging:
